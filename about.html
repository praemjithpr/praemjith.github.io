    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Praemjith, a passionate tech enthusiast with a strong interest in drones, robotics, AI, and software development. My journey began with hands-on projects in the Aviation and Robotics Club, where I built autonomous aerial systems and IoT-driven solutions. Over time, I expanded into web and mobile app development, blending creativity with problem-solving to craft impactful digital experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe in creating solutions that are functional, reliable, and user-friendly. From developing an AI-powered hexacopter for rescue operations to building a multilingual chatbot ticketing system and event management platforms, I approach each project with dedication and attention to detail. Hackathons and competitions fuel my drive to innovate and keep learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        My mindset of ‚Äúliving in beta mode‚Äù keeps me constantly exploring new technologies, improving my skills, and adapting to challenges. I enjoy collaborating with passionate teams, sharing knowledge, and pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in both hardware and software development.
